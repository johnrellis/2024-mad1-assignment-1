# Grading

When grading the android work, I will be looking for usages of:

* Functionality that actually works
* Correct usage of modifiers
* Extracted String Resources (e.g. for button or textbox labels)
* Images
* Row, Column, Box layouts
* Clean and concise kotlin
* Composable functions in separate files
* Usages of immutable kotlin collections
* Usages of data classes
* Tests that are clear and concise and test the correct thing
* No warnings or errors in your IDE

* You do not need to use ViewModels.  Fell free to use it, it will help you if you are in between grades but they are not necessary.
* You do not need to use NavHost and NavController (covered in week 7). Feel free to use it, it will help you if you are in between grades but they are not necessary.
* LazyColumn, LazyRow and Lazy Grids will get you some extra marks. These were covered in Week 7.
* It is a requirement that your app keeps state (e.g. displays driver) when the phone is rotated (rememberSaveable).
